Student Project Unreal
This project was one of my second-year exams. I was tasked with creating a combat system prototype for a Souls-like game.
I was the only person working on this project, so all the Blueprint code was created by me. The assets (models, animations) were sourced from free packs available on the Unreal Engine marketplace, specifically the "Paragon: Aurora" pack and the "Paragon: Greystone" pack.
